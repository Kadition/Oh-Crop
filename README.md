Instructions: To plant, drag the seed icon at the bottom of the screen to an available land plot. Once planted, seeds must be watered regularly with the raindrop. Drag the raindrop over dry plants to water them. But beware! While planting or watering, the player is unable to stop the crows which are trying to steal their precious harvest in the Barn! If a crow reaches the central barn, it's game over! Thankfully, your mouse comes equipped with a shotgun, so clicking on a crow stops it!
